A game of snap

##Here are the rules of the game:

* Two players are dealt the same number of cards from a shuffled deck.
* Each player takes it in turns to place their next card on a pile between them.
* If the two top cards on the pile match in numeric value (e.g. 9 == 9), the last player to place a card takes all the cards in the pile.
* The game continues until one player is out of cards.
